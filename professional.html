                Professional satisfaction and personal freedom have eluded me for over a decade. I discovered a passion for coding following a failed attempt at securing a tech support job 3 years ago, and I've pursued that passion ever since. My time at Galvanize provides a tremendous opportunity to turn this passion into a professional life, to fill in the gaps in my knowledge, and to build relationships with people who share my passion.
